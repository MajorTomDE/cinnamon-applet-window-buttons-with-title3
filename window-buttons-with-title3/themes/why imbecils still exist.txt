This is a question I keep asking myself over and over again: why do imbecils still exist?

Where the fuck is the option to create a repository (sub)folder in this moronic platform named GitHub?
One can create files;
One can upload files;
  But cannot upload too many at a time;
  Since all the required files are in a subfolder, a folder must be created here before uploading part of the files in it;
  But one cannot simply create a folder;
    One can only indirectly create a folder by asking to create a file, and then typing a folder name then a file name;
    Therefore I had to create this file.

Who the fuck put these imbecils in control of so many people's code?!? Or, is there any human involved AT ALL...???
