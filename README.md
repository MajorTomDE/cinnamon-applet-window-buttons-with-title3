# window-buttons-with-title3@majortom

Applet for Linux Cinnamon desktop, shows current window's title, icon and/or buttons in panel

![Example how to use applet in Cinnamon Panel](https://github.com/MajorTomDE/cinnamon-applet-window-buttons-with-title3/blob/72d146104bb28cdc9029017648c5c7047fd17669/screenshot.png?raw=true)

The example above shows a top panel with two applets

+ Middle: Applet 1 - Title only
+ Right: Applet 2 - Window Buttons



## Installation

You have to ensure the following folder name. Otherwise the applet will not load or work properly or at all.

```
window-buttons-with-title3@majortom
```

Applets are usually placed in folder:

```
~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets
```

So the complete path for the files is:

```
~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/window-buttons-with-title3@majortom
```



## Compatibility

I have tested the applet with

+ Linux Mint Cinnamon 21.2
+ Cinnamon Desktop 5.8.4
+ [WhiteSur Theme](https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1403328/)
+ [Cinnamon Maximus Extension](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/extensions/view/73)



## Miscellaneous

This is a fork from [mash-00](https://github.com/mash-00/window-buttons-with-title2/) which is also a fork of the quick fix [v2.1.0.](https://github.com/Drugwash2/window-buttons-with-title2) (works for Cinnamon 5.4 and later) of the previously fixed applet version [window-buttons-with-title2.hanspr.zip](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/files/2162829/window-buttons-with-title2.hanspr.zip) (works for Cinnamon < 5.4) of the original applet [window-buttons-with-title2@hanspr](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/tree/940615c0621ed152cd65d65edc6be97866e1acb2/window-buttons-with-title2%40hanspr) that was removed with [linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets@ab94732](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/commit/ab94732a8b979fcaed20eb5d6486d9ad16e229bd) (does not work in Cinnamon 3.8).

I'm not really a developer. I have adjusted the code with my limited capabilities and ChatGPT to my needs. I'm amazed how good it works and it was a cool exercice for me to play with github ;-) Therefore I can only provide very limited support.
